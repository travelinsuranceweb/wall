        <p>The tatoosh traverse consists of summitting 12 peaks of the tatoosh range, situated just south of mount rainier. The tatoosh traverse is a way to enjoy fine scenery, and bag a few peaks, while laughing at the hundreds of tiny dots laboring up to camp muir for their summit bid on rainier. Given the fact that liberty ridge is listed in the book as a ski tour, we should have known better.</p>
