        <p>Benach went back to the character&#039;s inspiration, a days of our lives clip featuring future harley quinn voice actress arleen sorkin, to help . The dungaree or jumpsuit that margot robbie wears in birds of prey for her harley quinn role is a gold one custom made for the movie. Birds of prey does pay homage to that particular shirt, but costume designer erin benach takes harley&#039;s multiple changes to the next level.</p>
